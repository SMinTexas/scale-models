            <article>So here is what I think will be a good story. Many years ago, before I met Rhonda, I was in a relationship with another gal (a gal who would stick a knife in my heart, but that opened the door to meet my wife so thanks for that knife!). I
                found myself in a long-since gone hobby shop in the Willowbrook Mall area of Houston, Texas, where I spied the Hasegawa Mc.202 Folgore kit. I walked out of there with three kits that day, and some time in 1997 or 1998, I built my first
                Italian fighter, the Folgore (which means "Thunderbolt" in Italian).
            </article>
            <article>Move the calendar up to some time in 2006 or 2007. I was recently hired at Icon Clinical Research (where I would do what to this point is the best work I have done in my career), and I got a call from my son Tyler. He had what would be some
                distressing news for me - he had come home with his Mom to find a bunch of crushed plastic on the floor of my garage workshop. Apparently the continual opening and closing of the laundry room door had, over time, dislodged the mounts on
                the display shelves that I had above my work bench. And on this dark day, the mount had finally given way, taking with the falling shelves many of the builds I completed when I first returned to this hobby in mid-1990s.
            </article>
            <article>At the time, I think I had less than 40 unbuilt model kits. Rhonda told me that it would be okay to replace all of those that I had lost in the shelving incident. I put all those broken parts into a box for possible future use, compiled a
                list, and set about finding each of them again. Over the next few years, I would acquire each one of the lost builds, some times the same kit, some times not.
            </article>
            <article>But I had initially replaced the 48th scale Folgore with a 32nd scale Folgore by a kit manufacturer that, in all frankness, should never have gotten into that market. The 21st Century Toys kit was a dog through and through, and now resides
                in a back corner of my work bench ready to test different painting patterns. In 2018, I ended up replacing that original Hasegawa release with another Hasegawa, this time acquired via eBay.
