                This was one of the long list of warbirds of World War II that eluded me as a child. It was one that I truly wanted to build way back when. So flashing forward many years, when I saw this kit on a hobby shop shelf, I of course snagged it.</article>
            <article>This was my first effort at weathering painted surfaces, which is visible in the one picture I have of the "Tante Ju", the nicknamed the Germans bestowed on this versatile transport aircraft.</article>

                The Ju52 currently hangs in my garage and is covered, I'm sure, by a thick coat of dust and cob-webs. I hope to pull it down, clean it up, and shoot several more photographs. And one final thing that I notice in the photograph is the date, which indicates
                that within a month my daughter was going to come into this world.
