            <article>The G3M "Nell" was one of those early war Japanese aircraft that always interested me. As a child, the easily-available kit manufacturers included Monogram, Revell, Lindberg, and Aurora - and none of those produced Japanese subjects for sale
                in the United States. But with the history of this bomber, as the primary bomber launched against Force Z on 10 December 1941 that resulted in the sinking of the British warships, HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse, I wanted to build
                the "Nell". My interest in the "Nell" only increased when Tamiya released their excellent kit of the "Nell's" younger "sister", the G4M "Betty".

            <article>It was on a trip to the Scale Model Gallery aboard the U.S.S. Lexington aircraft carrier in Corpus Christi, Texas, when I saw a well-done model of the "Nell" on display. Once I tracked down the manufacturer and found one at an on-line retailer,
                I of course bought it.
            </article>
            <article>I would love another attempt at the "Nell", although in 48th scale. If you look closely at the photographs below, you may observe that the "glass" areas appear fogged over. The reason for this is that I had removed the masking material from
                those parts prior to coating the entire build with a clear flat spray.
