            <article>Yes, that completion date was intended. I had dubbed the year 2018 as my "Year of the Axis Build", with the goal of completing each of the primary aircraft involved in the December 7th attack on Pearl Harbor by December 7, 2018. I was able
                to do just that, with three builds of the D3A1 "Val", B5N2 "Kate", and a Zero that technically was not the correct variant for the date (but I had no plans to purchase an era-correct kit).
            </article>
            <article>When I bought this kit more than a decade ago, I had intended to build the "Kate" with the wings folded. But as the time to actually build her approached, I could not get past the notion that I like to look at aircraft in their natural state
                - with the wings fully extended. So even though the kit included a pricey upgrade, I opted to leave all the wing-fold parts off and build her ready for flight.
