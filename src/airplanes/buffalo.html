                The Buffalo was not a very good airplane, but I had always wanted to build one. I think some time in the early part of the 2000s, I found it on the shelf at Hobby Lobby. I bought one but that was after I had mentioned it to my mother-in-law, who ended
                up getting one of these for me for Christmas. I still have one waiting to be built as a result. This kit was typical Tamiya quality. It went together without any issues, and I had a good time going outside of my normal comfort zone by
                doing a Buffalo in a more-or-less obscure military from World War II.
