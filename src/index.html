    <p class="intro">
        One of my earliest memories is being in a K-Mart with my parents when I was three years old. Of course, we ended up going down the toy aisle, as many parents with young children know all too well. I spied this really neat airplane featuring a prominent
        shark's mouth and eyes on its nose. It was Monogram P-40B Flying Tiger. We went home that day with the P-40 and a Monogram P-38 Lightning that my Dad would build alongside helping me with the Flying Tiger.
    </p>
    <p class="intro">
        And so began my introduction to the world of scale models. I still remember those baby blue boxes that the Monogram kits came in in the late 1960s, early 1970s, so much so that I have acquired nearly every one of those kits via eBay. I have the P-40B,
        still sealed in its cellophane wrapper, on a shelf in my display cabinet that I refer to as my Flying Tiger shelf (it currently holds the unopened kit plus five built-up P-40s of various variants).
    </p>
    <p class="intro">
        Model building was a big part of my childhood, mostly Monogram and Revell kits. That hobby took a back seat when I discovered baseball and girls in high school. I built a few kits during those years and throughout my years at Texas A&M University, and
        then again after graduation when the first Persian Gulf War started.
    </p>
    <p class="intro">
        Some time after I had begun my career as a software engineer, I felt a calling to return to this hobby. I found myself in a store one Sunday afternoon - curiously, another K-Mart - when I set eyes upon a Revell Beaufighter in 32nd scale. I'd never before
        built that warbird, but it was one of the best looking airplanes. I walked out of that K-Mart with the Beaufighter, several other airplanes of WWII vintage, and the minimum supplies needed to put them together.
    </p>
    <p class="intro">
        Initially, I built models as I had when I was a kid - not particularly bad, but not great either. But over time, I discovered many sources (magazines, online articles, videos, etc) that led me to try out and perfect techniques new to me, which in turn
        led to better quality models. I have had photographs of three of my builds published in the magazine <i>Fine Scale Modeler</i> (November 2012, May 2017, and May 2019). I also have donated three builds to the Scale Model Gallery located
        aboard the U.S.S. Lexington aircraft carrier in Corpus Christi, Texas.
